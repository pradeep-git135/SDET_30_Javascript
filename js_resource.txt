# installations: 
	* platform : NodeJs
	* IDE: vs_code 


# Javascript : 
	*] it is an intrpreted programming as well as scripting language
	*] javascript is case sensitive 
	*] javascript is a dynamically typed language

# Translaters	: 
	used to convert language from one form to other and based on the mechanism we have 3 different types of translaters
	1] compilers
	2] assemblers
	3] interpreters

# Uses:
	*] it is mainly used for client side validation(component validation)
	*] it is used to develop interactive/ dynamic web applications
	*] it can can be used in client side, server side and even in database so it is used in fullstack
	
# Libraries built by using Javascript:
	JQuery, Load#, Bootstrap, _js etc...

# Frameworks built by using Javascript:
	NodeJS, ReactJS, ReactNative, AngularJs, ElectronJs, Tensorflow  etc...
	
Javascript Engine:
	chrome browser ===> v8
	mozillay firefox ===> spider monkey
	ie      ===> chakra
	safari ===> jscore

#] execution of javascript code:
	1] on browser
			embedding javascript in html:
					1] inline embed  [<script></script>]

					2] external embed [<script src="file/path/javascript "></script>]
	2] off browser(server  nodeJs):
				node <file/path>

#] Tokens:
	smallest unit of code is called tokens
		1] keywords :
				keyword are predefined words with predefined meaning in it (developers had defined already)
				35 keywords in javascript
				keywords are case sensitive (all the keyword are in lower case)
				e.g. var, let, const, if, else, for, while, do while ....

		2] identifiers: 
				user defined words/ named memory used to store the value
				you can not use any keyword as an identifier
				identifier should not start with numeric but it can be alphanumeric
				we should not use special charecter in identifiers expect _ and $
		3] literals:
				values that we store inside an identifier
		4] operaters:
				are used to perform action on operands 
				arithmatic operaters
				relational operaters
				logical operaters
				comparison operaters
		5] separeters:
				e.g  (), {}, [], ;, :
		
#] how to declare a veriable in javascript:
	var a;  //declaration        ===> var a = 100;  // declaration and iniztialization
	a = 100; // initialization
	log(a); // utilization

#] datatypes:
	1) premitive:
			number, string, boolean, undefined, null
	2) non premitive:
			array, object, functions....

#] flow control statements:
	1] conditional statements [if, else, if_else, switch]
	2] looping statements[for, while, do_while]
