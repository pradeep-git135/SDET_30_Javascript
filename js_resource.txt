# installations: 
	* platform : NodeJs
	* IDE: vs_code 


# Javascript : 
	*] it is an intrpreted programming as well as scripting language
	*] javascript is case sensitive 
	*] javascript is a dynamically typed language

# Translaters	: 
	used to convert language from one form to other and based on the mechanism we have 3 different types of translaters
	1] compilers
	2] assemblers
	3] interpreters

# Uses:
	*] it is mainly used for client side validation(component validation)
	*] it is used to develop interactive/ dynamic web applications
	*] it can can be used in client side, server side and even in database so it is used in fullstack
	
# Libraries built by using Javascript:
	JQuery, Load#, Bootstrap, _js etc...

# Frameworks built by using Javascript:
	NodeJS, ReactJS, ReactNative, AngularJs, ElectronJs, Tensorflow  etc...
	
Javascript Engine:
	chrome browser ===> v8
	mozillay firefox ===> spider monkey
	ie      ===> chakra
	safari ===> jscore

#] execution of javascript code:
	1] on browser
			embedding javascript in html:
					1] inline embed  [<script></script>]

					2] external embed [<script src="file/path/javascript "></script>]
	2] off browser(server  nodeJs):
				node <file/path>

#] Tokens:
	smallest unit of code is called tokens
		1] keywords :
				keyword are predefined words with predefined meaning in it (developers had defined already)
				35 keywords in javascript
				keywords are case sensitive (all the keyword are in lower case)
				e.g. var, let, const, if, else, for, while, do while ....

		2] identifiers: 
				user defined words/ named memory used to store the value
				you can not use any keyword as an identifier
				identifier should not start with numeric but it can be alphanumeric
				we should not use special charecter in identifiers expect _ and $
		3] literals:
				values that we store inside an identifier
		4] operaters:
				are used to perform action on operands 
				arithmatic operaters
				relational operaters
				logical operaters
				comparison operaters
		5] separeters:
				e.g  (), {}, [], ;, :
		
#] how to declare a veriable in javascript:
	var a;  //declaration        ===> var a = 100;  // declaration and iniztialization
	a = 100; // initialization
	log(a); // utilization

#] datatypes:
	1) premitive:
			number, string, boolean, undefined, null
	2) non premitive:
			array, object, functions....

#] flow control statements:
	1] conditional statements [if, else, if_else, switch]
	2] looping statements[for, while, do_while]

#] functions:
		block of coed which perform a specific task, and it can reuseable
	1] standard function/ function declaration:
			syntax: 
					function name_of_function () { // statements}
			invocation:
					name_of_function ()
	2] function expression :
			syntax: 
					var name_of_functionn = function  () { // statements}
			invocation:
					name_of_function()
	3] IIf==> immediatly invocable function:
			syntax: 
					(function  (params) { // statements})(params)
	4]arrow function : 
			syntax:
					() => {}

# callback functions:
	passing function or function as a parameter to another function and invocking in it is called 

e.g. 	function ecommerce(status) {
    		if (status() == "paymentSuccessful") {
        		console.log("product booked successfully");
    		} else {
        		console.log("insufficient balence");
    		}
    
		}
		//passing entire function as a parameter
		ecommerce(function paymentStatus() {
   			 return "23r3paymentSuccessful"
		})
		//passing function reference as a parameter
			ecommerce(paymentStatus)
	
#programm execution in memory:
	* whenever you execute javascript code, a global execution context will be created 
	* In global execution context a global object will be created named window
	* Along with window_Object global veriable will be created called this
	* in the global levell window === this
	* Then 2 phases will be created 1] creation phase 2] execution phase 
	* In creation phase memory will be created for the entire code and dummy value (undefinde) will be assigned for all the veriables 
	* Then the entire code reaches the execution phase 
	* In execution phase undefined will get overided with  actual values and line by line code will execute

# veriable and function hoisting:
